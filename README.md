# MPIforParallelEarthElevationData

This repo is dedicated to a HPC project. It consists in parallelizing a least squares computation to compute Earth Elevation Data (see the subject for more information). Parallelization has been acheived using routines from the BLAS and ScaLAPACK libraries, results are discussed in the report in the par_scalapack folder.
